# Subnetting-Solver in C++


This is a simple Subnettingquestions-Solver implemented in C++ as my first project.
(Will get Updates).

Currently it can support:

- Converting IP version 4 Adresses to IP version 6 Adresses
- Determination of the Subnet of given IPV4 Address
- VLSM Subnetting Questions:
      
      - Generate VLSM subnetting szenarios (variable hosts and addresses or custom ones)
      - Solve VLSM Subnetting Szenerios  (customs ones and generated ones)
       

Can you use this freely? 
Yeah feel free to play around with the code. Drop me a line if you find it useful.
